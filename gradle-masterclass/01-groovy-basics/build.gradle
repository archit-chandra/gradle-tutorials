// NOTES: closures {}
//   1. It is like lambdas, {code_blocks}
//   2. It can be assigned to a variable = the value of the last statement
//   3. It is like method and return the value of the last statement
//   4. It can take parameters (typed/untyped)
//   5. It can be passed as parameter to the method (it must be the last argument among parameters)
//   6. Use closure() to execute the statements in the closure
//   7. It keeps the reference to the context (object) in which they are defined (and not their values)
